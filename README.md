# symNMF
Symmetric NMF with L1 and L2-like regularization and support for missing values.

Based on Zhu et al. (2018), "Dropping Symmetry for Fast Symmetric Nonnegative Matrix Factorization", and Cichocki and Phan (2008), "Fast Local Algorithms for Large Scale Nonnegative Matrix and
Tensor Factorizations"
